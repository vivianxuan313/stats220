# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Science majoring in Data Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is a required course for my degree.
- I am interested in learning about this course because it is one of the most data science relevant courses in my degree that I have done so far, with an even percentage of computational and statistical aspects involved.
